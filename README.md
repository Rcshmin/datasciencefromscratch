## motivation

This is a repository I have created to **track my progress** in data science and any other related fields :chart_with_upwards_trend: . Hopefully, in doing so, I am able to better *motivate myself* :full_moon_with_face:, *organise my goals* :paperclip: and create a place where I can ***showcase my work*** :file_folder:.
